This policy allows "Infrastructure Modification" actions. Infrastructure Modification describes IAM actions with "modify" capabilities, and can therefore lead to [Resource Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1496/), unauthorized creation of Infrastructure, Backdoor creation, and/or modification of existing resources which can result in downtime. For example, `ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress` grants the permission to add one or more inbound rules to a security group; malicious usage of this IAM action could potentially lead to downtime or unintentional exposure of compute resources.
