# Versioning

We try to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) as much as possible.

## Version bumps.

Just edit the `cloudsplaining/bin/version.py` file and update the __version__ variable:

```python
__version__ = '0.0.1'  # EDIT THIS
```

The setup.py file will automatically pick up the new version from that file for the package info. The `@click.version_option` decorator will also pick that up for the command line.
