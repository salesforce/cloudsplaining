This report contains the security assessment results from [Cloudsplaining](https://github.com/salesforce/cloudsplaining), which maps out the IAM risk landscape in a report, identifies where resource ARN constraints are not used, and identifies other risks in IAM policies like [Privilege Escalation](#definition-privilege-escalation), [Resource Exposure](#definition-resource-exposure), [Infrastructure Modification](#definition-infrastructure-modification), and [Data Exfiltration](#definition-data-exfiltration). Remediating these issues, where necessary, will help to limit the blast radius in the case of compromised AWS credentials.
